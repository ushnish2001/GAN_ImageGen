Project Title: GAN-Based Image Generation

Description:
This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating realistic images. 
A GAN consists of a generator network that creates new images and a discriminator network that evaluates their authenticity. 
By training these networks in a competitive process, the generator learns to produce highly convincing images.

Data Preparation:
Download and preprocess a suitable image dataset (e.g., CelebA, MNIST, CIFAR-10).
Normalize pixel values to the range [-1, 1].
Model Creation:
Define the generator and discriminator networks using appropriate architectures (e.g., DCGAN, WGAN, StyleGAN).
Set up the adversarial training process.
Training:
Train the GAN for a specified number of epochs.
Monitor the training process using loss functions and generated image samples.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the quality of generated images using visual inspection and quantitative metrics (e.g., Inception Score, Fr√©chet Inception Distance).
